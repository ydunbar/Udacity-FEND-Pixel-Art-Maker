# Pixel Art Maker Project


## Project Overview

This is a project for the Grow With Google Scholarship course from Udacity. Students were given a static starter file to work with, and were asked to build the functionality of the app in Javascript. This app utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery, as well as html2canvas to save artwork. 

## How to Use

Start by choosing a grid size for your drawing canvas. Then you choose a color to draw with, or stick with black. Click on a grid square to color it, drag to draw across several grid squares, and double-click on a square to erase. Click on "Save Art" to save your artwork as a PDF.
